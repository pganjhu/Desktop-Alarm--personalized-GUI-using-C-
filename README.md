# Desktop-Alarm--personalized-GUI-using-C-
A person browsing internet finds difficulty in managing the right amount of time to be spent browsing a webpage. The idea is to develop an application that will keep track of browsing time. The alarm clock efficiently manages the browsing time of the user by keeping track of how much time exactly the user has to spend on browsing the webpage. Alarm clock is used to set the time as a reminder. Once the set time occurs, the alarm either beeps or a pop up message will be displayed. If the user has to jot down an important point or some links, then clipboard can be used. It allows a user to save multiple links. Instances may arise when a user needs to perform brief calculations and conversions while browsing session then he/she can make use of calculator and currency convertor tabs. Thereby it will be a personalized Graphical User Interface.
